# Getting started

---
Charm UI - is a minimalistic CSS and React components libary for creating simple and beautiful documentation or blog websites. It's developed with **InterUI** font family in mind.

## Installation
Charm can be downloaded through **npm** and includes two version of CSS styles and React layout components:

```js
npm install charm-ui -S
```

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files:

```text
charm-ui/
└── dist/
    ├── charm.classed.css
    ├── charm.tagged.css
    └── esm/ (commonjs/)
        └── layout/
            └── index.js
```

### CSS
Charm CSS library includes two different versions:

```js
// Use tagged css version
import 'charm-ui/dist/charm.tagged.css';

// Use classed css version
import 'charm-ui/dist/charm.classed.css';
```

Or simply linking css file in your browser:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/charm-ui/dist/charm.tagged.css">
```

* If you prefer to **use html tags**, start with `charm.tagged` css library.
* If you prefer to **use css classes**, you can use `charm.classed` css.

Any versions also includes minimal CSS resets, Utility classes and some Layout components for better presentation. Most of times you can just drop tagged version of Charm and write plain html or **MDX**. You can also use static site generators like **GatsbyJS**.

> Charm is only a minimal UI presentation of your website. You can extend, update or change and use CharmUI the way you want

### JS
Charm also contains some basic JS layout components that can be used within React. You can read more about Charm layout components on [Components page](/components/ "Components").
