# Getting started

---
Charm UI - is a minimalistic CSS and JS libary for creating simple and beautiful documentation or blog websites. It's developed to be used with **MDX** and **InterUI** font families.

### Installation
Charm can be downloaded through **npm**:

```js
npm i charm-ui -S
```

Next, you would like to import global css files to your project:

```js
// Use tagged css version
import 'charm-ui/dist/charm.tagged.css';

// Use classed css version
import 'charm-ui/dist/charm.classed.css';
```

Or simply linking css file in your browser:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/charm-ui/dist/charm.tagged.css">
```

### CSS
Charm CSS library consist of two different versions:

* If you prefer to **use html tags**, start with `charm.tagged` css library.
* If you prefer to **use css classes**, you can use `charm.classed` css.

With any of this versions you will also get minimal CSS resets, **Utility classes** and some **Layout components** for better presentation. Most of times you can just drop tagged version of Charm and write plain html or **MDX**. You can also use static site generators like **GatsbyJS**. Read more about usage with static site generators on [Usage page](/usage/ "Usage").

> Charm is only a minimal UI presentation of your website. You can extend, update or change and use CharmUI the way you want

### JS
Charm also contains some basic JS layout components that can be used within React. You can read more about React components on [Components page](/components/ "Components").
